# shrinkmusic
Shrinks a big directory of music. Like a version of rsync for music, that
lossily compresses certain formats to Opus. Useful for copying a large music
collection onto a less large SD card for use on Android.

## Dependencies
- ffmpeg with libopus, support for whatever formats your collection has
- shntool
- cuetools

## Features
- Has a dry run mode
- Skips pre-existing files (e.g., to update collection on your SD card)
- Attempts to determine whether conversion is worthwhile or not (e.g., for any
  old .mp3, it probably isn't...)
- Supports selective ignoring of files/directories
- Splits, tags, and converts XXX.cue and XXX.flac pairs
- Runs in parallel
